## Final Code Institute Stream1 Project 

### Project Title: SKStream1-SwingCrew Band Web App


#### Overview

The project is built using angularjs and Bootstrap features. This app is a working prototype SwingCrew band web App (swing/jive) that provides services to the communities in Ireland.Thus, the project features Angularjs framework including controllers and viewers together, properties and functions, directives and services in a simple to follow manner to show case the activities of the band. The main web application languages used for stream1 include HTML, CSS, Jquery, Javascript and Bootstrap.

### Prerequisites 
Firstly sign in [GitHub](http://github.com) if you haven't already and create the project repository. Secondly, download [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download). For this project you need to install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) which include latest version of npm. Using npm Install: install libraries and dependencies (Package.json) install Bower.json and using bower install, install Angularjs framework, bootstrap and also this allows you to add any dependencies such as audioplayer, fontowesome etc. For more information on how to start check official website for AngularJS.


### Tech Used
1. NPM -npm is the basis for managing some of the dependencies in our application
2. Angularjs- Angular for page routing, creating custom services and directives. Other Angularjs for touch-animate and audioplayer.
3. Bootstrap - Bootstrap to provide responsive layout and simplify styling
4. Bower - Bower for installing and managing libraries and frameworks such as bootstrap, Jquery and Angularjs 
5. sublime - Text editor used for this project but you are free to chooseany editor.
6. Http-server - This is installed to allow localhost to run the project and update saved changes.
7. github - used for this project as the version control platform

### Getting the code up and running

To use this code please clone/fork or download this repository or use commandline by running the git clone [SKstream1](https://github.com/Mauya/SKstream1)  

Once npm and bower are installed, you need to install the required dependencies in package.json and bower.json (open sublime/other text editor to check these files). Use git to install (in windows):

* npm install

* bower install

After installing the dependencies, also ensure http-server is installed and runnung. The project then run on localhost - 8080

### Deploying the Project

* The project is deployed via the github pages (gh-pages).

### Testing

Testing is on-going but Angularjs is complex for any beginner and this becomes all important. Also the use of dependency injection makes it easy to test application code. The javaScript code in the project is checked using JSHint. Also console testing is on-going.
