"# SKStream1" 

# Angular Todo App -Based on this for basis.
 
## Overview
 	This is base template for a band prototype that performs various events. This contains the core files that are needed to work on this peoject or fork it.

	Using bower install can add any dependencies such as mediaplayer, videogular.
	For more information on how to start there are Private CodeInstitute tutorials. Also can check official website for Angular2

###Tech Used
	*npm
        **npm basis for managing some of the dependencies in our application
 	*AngularJS
    	**AngularJS for page routing, creating custom services and directives. Other Anguar js for touch animate. 
    *Bootstrap
        **Bootstrap to provide responsive layout and simplify styling
    *bower
        **Bower for installing libraries and frameworks such as Jquery and Angularjs
    *Http-server
    	**This is installed to allow localhost to run the project and update saved changes.

###Getting the code up and running

    To use this clone/fork or download this repository or use commandline by running the git clone <projectstream1 Github URL> command
    
    Once npm and bower are installed, one needs to install the required dependencies in package.json and bower.json (open sublime/other text editor to check these files). Use git to install (in windows):

    **npm install

    **bower install

    After installing the dependencies, also ensure http-server is installed and runnung. The project then run on localhost
    
## Testing
	Testing is on-going but Angular2 is complex for any beginner and this becomes all important. Also the use of dependency injection makes it easy to test application code.
